it will identify the background color of an existing webpage, then use a URL for an image from an existing webpage

let this serve as a lesson to any students who are taking on this task: use a real-time sandbox or live refresh A LOT when doing this coding. i nearly ripped my hair out trying to figure out what my navbar was missing, to get the left-and-right split of items. after redoing the code 3 separate times, i found out that the issue at hand was a missing </div> tag, which caused the alignment for the left side of the flexbox to supersede my right-side alignments/justifications -_-
